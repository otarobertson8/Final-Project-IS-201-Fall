     <p id="top2">Pickleball is a fast-growing paddle sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis.</p>  
        It is played on a small, rectangular court with a paddle, 
        a plastic perforated ball, and a low net, making it accessible and easy to set up. 
        The game is known for being easy to learn, fun for all ages, 
        and social, yet it can also be highly competitive at advanced levels. 
        Pickleball emphasizes strategy, quick reflexes, and precise placement rather than sheer power, 
        allowing players of varying skill levels to enjoy long rallies and exciting gameplay. 
        Its combination of simplicity and depth has made it one of the fastest-growing sports 
        in the world, attracting players from beginners to professional athletes.

<h2>HISTORY OF PICKLEBALL</h2>
Pickleball was invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington, by Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, 
and Barney McCallum as a family-friendly backyard game. 
They combined elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis using a lowered net, 
paddles, and a perforated plastic ball. The game’s popularity grew quickly because it was easy to learn, 
required less space than tennis, and was suitable for all ages. In the 1970s and 1980s, 
community centers and schools began adding pickleball courts, helping it spread across the United States. 
Today, pickleball is one of the fastest-growing sports worldwide, with professional tours, 
international competitions, and a rapidly expanding player base.

    <h2>PRO PICKLEBALL SCENE</h2>
The professional pickleball scene has grown rapidly over the past decade, transforming from a niche hobby into a competitive, widely recognized sport. Major tours like the Professional Pickleball Association (PPA), Association of Pickleball Professionals (APP), and the Major League Pickleball (MLP) host tournaments across the United States and internationally, offering significant prize money and media coverage. Top players compete in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, with some achieving “triple crown” victories by winning all three events at the same tournament. The sport attracts athletes from diverse backgrounds, including former tennis, badminton, and table tennis players, contributing to high-level, fast-paced competition. Sponsorships, streaming platforms, and social media have elevated the visibility of pros, helping to grow fanbases and inspire a new generation of players. With increasing professionalism, structured rankings, and growing global participation, 
the pickleball pro scene is quickly establishing itself as a mainstream competitive sport.
